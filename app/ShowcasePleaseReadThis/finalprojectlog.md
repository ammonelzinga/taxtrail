I've worked on 3 different projects throughout this semester.

TortillaThyme is a recipe site that can scrape recipes, and for family recipe groups.
I dropped the ball on it, and it is still pretty buggy but I like it and I hope to pick it back up.

TaxTrail is an app that helps self employed individuals prepare their quarterly estimated taxes. 
The goal was for it to provide real time miles tracking through maps, receipt anaylzing to get expenses,
and a pdf generation tool that autofills the 1040-ES based on the user's data, and other inputs they provide. 
This app is the most buggy, and I don't have a website for it yet, just an expo react native app still in development. 

ScriptureLensAI is a website to help people find, study, and compare scriptures both in the Church's cannon, and other sources such as the Pseudepigrapha.
I embed scripture chunks and use that to help with search tools. This project was half done for this class and half done for another class. So although I have 
spent over 20 hours on this one, I am only counting 10 hours for this class so I'm not double dipping haha.
