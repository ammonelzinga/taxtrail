Hi welcome to the design of TaxTrail

The purpose of the app is to help people do their quarterly self employment taxes to help them avoid the underpayment penalty. 

Key features include: Receipt parsing and storage, PDF geneartion for form 1040-ES, and  miles tracker

Right now I am using Expo React Native and supabase. Probably will need to use Google's map api service for android. Apple has a built in mapkit I believe on their phones. I am using some open source packages to help with receipt parsing and pdf generation. Might need to use openai for the receipt parsing if the built in algorithm is not good enough. 

Please go to my designPhotos folder to see the database model, super simple systems design, and more. I hope to have a pretty functional app by the time I turn in the project.
